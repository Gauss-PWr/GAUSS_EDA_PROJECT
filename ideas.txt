-- What can be analysed

Accident Frequency by Category (more ideas)
* Hour - (distribution of accidents throughout the day)
* Cause of accident

Instead of looking only at the fatal injury ratio, we can
analyse the distribution of all three types of injuries
by columns mentioned above and additionally by:
* Age band of driver
* Educational level
* Driving experience
* Type of vehicle
* Area of accident
* Road surface type
* Road surface conditions
* Vehicle movement type
* Cause of accident
* Sex of driver - (Men are said to be more prone to reckless driving, it could be worth to fact-check that)

Accident Frequency by Category and Type of junction
* Driving experience - (Maybe drivers with different experience cause accidents on different types of junctions?)
* Type of vehicle - (Bigger vehicles may struggle with certain types of junctions, which could increase accident rate)

Accident Frequency by Category and Road surface
* Driving experience - (Drivers with higher experience may pose less of a danger on wet or damp surfaces)
* Type of vehicle - (Bigger vehicles may struggle on wet surfaces, which could increase accident rate)

Accident Frequency by Category and Light conditions
* Driving experience - (Drivers with higher experience may pose less of a danger at night)

Accident Frequency by Category and Weather conditions
* Driving experience - (Drivers with higher experience may pose less of a danger druing rainy wather)
* Type of vehicle - (Bigger vehicles may struggle on wet surfaces, which could increase accident rate)

Mean/Median Number of casualties by Category
* Age band of driver
* Driving experience
* Type of vehicle
* Area of accident
* Type of junction
* Road surface conditions
* Light conditions
* Weather conditions
* Number of vehicles
* Vehicle movement

Accident Frequency by Category and Vehicle movement
* Drivers experience - (Drivers with lower experience may pose more of a danger during moving backwards or making a U-turn)
* Type of vehicle

Accident Frequency by Category and Cause of accident
* Age band of driver
* Education level
* Driving experience
* Type of vehicle
* Area of accident
* Type of junction
* Road surface conditions
* Light conditions
* Weather conditions
* Number of casualties
* Vehicle movement
